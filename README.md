<b><h2>FDF graphic project</h2></b><br>

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to this program. 

<ul>For my mandatory part, I were allowed to use the following <b>functions</b>:
<li> open, read, write, close</li>
<li> malloc, free</li>
<li> perror, strerror</li>
<li> exit</li>
<li> All the functions defined in the math library (-lm and man 3 math)</li>
<li> All the functions defined in the miniLibX library.</li>
  </ul>
